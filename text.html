    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>



    <p>

      This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the

      page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.

    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>

    <p>

      Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure

      of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or

      lower-level headings)

    </p>

    

    <p><em>What should this be?</em> I don't know but I will emphasize it.</p>



    <h3>Another Sub-Heading</h3>

    <p>

      Here you can see <em>another</em> sub-heading. But should this be a heading? <br >

      Probably not. Too much info/text now.

      <em>right?</em>



      <br > <br > <br><br>





      <h3>And Another Sub-Heading

        </h3>



        <p> <em>More</em> headings?? Here you can see another sub-heading. You know what to do now. Let's use a proper tag. </p>

<h4>Yet Another Sub-Heading

  </h4>

  <p>That's a lot of headings. Here you can see another sub-heading. You know what to do now.  Make this <strong>WORD</strong> strong aka bold. Give it a proper tag!</p>
